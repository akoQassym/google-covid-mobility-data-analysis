# Machine Learning Model Development for Smart City Traffic Analysis

- Accomplished training of deep neural networks and decision trees to estimate traffic speed and flow for specific freeway segments using data sourced from the Freeway PeMS database.
- Measurement: Achieved an average accuracy of 95% on the models.
- Approach: Utilized Numpy, Sklearn, Keras, TensorFlow, and Pandas packages for implementation.
